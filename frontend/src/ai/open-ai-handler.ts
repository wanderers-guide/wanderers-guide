  You change your grip on the shield, allowing you to combine rapid attacks with your shield boss or shield spikes and your main weapon’s Strikes in a series of swift motions. You reduce your [[shield boss]] and shield spikes weapon damage die to 1d4 and your Strikes gain the agile weapon trait.

Detection, revelation, and scrying effects pass right over you, your possessions, and your auras, detecting nothing unless the detecting effect has a counteract level of 10 or higher. For example, detect magic would still detect other magic in the area but not any magic on you, true seeing wouldn’t reveal you, locate or scrying wouldn’t find you, and so on.
